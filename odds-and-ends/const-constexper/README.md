# C++ Const and Constexpr Guide

The `const` and `constexpr` keywords are fundamental parts of modern C++ programming that enable developers to express
immutability and compile-time computation. The `const` keyword dates back to the original C++ standard (C++98) and was
designed to express the concept of immutability—values that cannot be changed after initialization. This pattern helps
catch errors at compile time, enables compiler optimizations, and communicates intent in code. The `constexpr` keyword,
introduced in C++11, extended these concepts by enabling compile-time evaluation of expressions and functions, allowing
computations to be shifted from runtime to compile time, which can lead to significant performance improvements and
stronger guarantees about program behavior.

## Use Cases and Problem Solutions

### Const
- **Immutable Values**: Preventing accidental modification of values that should remain constant throughout their lifetime.
- **API Design**: Communicating that a function does not modify its parameters or the object it's called on.
- **Thread Safety**: Const objects can be safely shared between threads without synchronization (if they contain no mutable members).
- **Compiler Optimizations**: Enables compiler to make certain optimizations based on the knowledge that values won't change.
- **Pointer/Reference Safety**: Distinguishing between pointers/references that can modify their target (`T*`) and those that cannot (`const T*`).

### Constexpr
- **Compile-time Computation**: Moving calculations from runtime to compile time, reducing the work done during program execution.
- **Guaranteed Optimization**: Ensuring computations are performed at compile time rather than hoping for compiler optimizations.
- **Template Metaprogramming**: Simplifying complex template metaprogramming tasks that previously required convoluted techniques.
- **Embedded Systems**: Creating values known at compile time for systems with limited resources.
- **Metadata Generation**: Generating lookup tables and other metadata structures at compile time.
- **Performance-Critical Applications**: Reducing runtime overhead for performance-sensitive code.

## Examples and Usage

### Basic Const Usage

```cpp
const int kValue = 42;  // Immutable value
const int& kRef = someVariable;  // Reference that cannot modify the referenced value
const int* ptr = &someVariable;  // Pointer to const (can't modify what it points to)
int* const constPtr = &someVariable;  // Const pointer (can't change what it points to)
```

### Const Member Functions

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int getValue() const {  // Promise not to modify object state
        return m_value;
    }
    
private:
    int m_value;
};
```

### Basic Constexpr Usage

```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

constexpr int kValue = square(5);  // Computed at compile time
static_assert(kValue == 25, "Compile time assertion");
```

### Advanced Constexpr Usage (C++14 and beyond)

```cpp
constexpr int factorial(int n) {
    return (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1));
}

template <typename T>
constexpr auto get_type_category() {
    if constexpr (std::is_integral_v<T>) {
        return "integral";
    } else if constexpr (std::is_floating_point_v<T>) {
        return "floating point";
    } else {
        return "other";
    }
}
```

## Good Practices

1. **Be Consistent**: Use `const` wherever applicable to clearly communicate immutability intentions.
2. **Const by Default**: Consider making variables, parameters, and return values `const` by default unless mutability is needed.
3. **Mark Member Functions as `const`**: Whenever a member function doesn't modify object state, mark it as `const`.
4. **Use `constexpr` for Compile-time Computation**: If a function or value can be computed at compile time, consider using `constexpr`.
5. **Test Compile-time Evaluation**: Use `static_assert` to verify that `constexpr` values are being computed as expected.

## Bad Practices

1. **Casting Away `const`**: Avoid `const_cast` to remove constness, as it undermines the safety guarantees.
2. **Mutable Overuse**: Don't mark members as `mutable` just to work around `const` constraints without good reason.
3. **Inconsistent `const` Usage**: Using `const` sporadically makes code harder to understand and reason about.
4. **Complex `constexpr` Functions**: Just because a function can be `constexpr` doesn't mean it should be; complex compile-time computations can increase compilation time.
