# C++ Move Semantics Demonstration

Move semantics is a fundamental design pattern in modern C++ that was introduced with C++11. This pattern represents a
major optimization for resource management by allowing resources (such as memory) to be transferred between objects without
expensive copying operations. Before move semantics, C++ programs often suffered from unnecessary deep copies when temporary
objects were passed or returned by value. This was particularly problematic for resource-managing classes, such as
containers with dynamically allocated memory (like `std::vector` or `std::string`). Move semantics solved this by
introducing rvalue references (denoted by `Type&&`) and the `std::move` utility function, which allow the "stealing" of
resources from temporary objects that are about to be destroyed, avoiding needless duplication.

Move semantics addresses several critical problems in C++ programming. First, it dramatically improves performance for
operations involving temporary objects, such as returning large objects from functions or inserting elements into
containers. Second, it enables the implementation of move-only types like `std::unique_ptr`, which provide exclusive
ownership semantics that are essential for resource safety. Third, it facilitates more efficient in-place construction and
manipulation of objects in containers. Move semantics follow the principle that a moved-from object should be left in a
valid but unspecified state, meaning it can safely be destroyed or reassigned, but not necessarily used otherwise without
reinitializing it first. This pattern has become a cornerstone of modern C++ programming and is essential for writing
high-performance code.

## Key Components of Move Semantics

1. **Rvalue References (`Type&&`)** - A new reference type that can bind to temporary objects (rvalues).
2. **std::move()** - A utility function that converts lvalues to rvalues, enabling move operations.
3. **Move Constructors** - Special constructors that transfer resources from a temporary object.
4. **Move Assignment Operators** - Special assignment operators that transfer resources from a temporary object.

## Common Use Cases

- Transferring ownership of resources (dynamic memory, file handles, etc.) between objects
- Optimizing container operations (insertion, resizing, etc.)
- Implementing move-only types (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`)
- Returning large objects from functions efficiently
- Implementing swap operations without intermediate copies

## Implementing Move Semantics

To implement move semantics for a class, you typically need to:

1. Define a move constructor: `ClassName(ClassName&& other) noexcept;`
2. Define a move assignment operator: `ClassName& operator=(ClassName&& other) noexcept;`
3. Ensure moved-from objects are left in a valid but possibly empty state
4. Mark move operations as `noexcept` when possible (improves optimization opportunities)

## Best Practices

- Always leave moved-from objects in a valid state
- Make move operations `noexcept` when possible
- Consider the Rule of Five: if you need a destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator, you probably need move operations too
- Use `std::move` when you want to explicitly enable move semantics for an object
- Be careful with move semantics in class hierarchies, especially with polymorphic classes
- Prefer returning by value and let the compiler optimize with move semantics or copy elision

## Common Pitfalls

- Moving from objects that are still needed later in the code
- Assuming specific values in moved-from objects
- Forgetting to handle self-assignment in move assignment operators
- Not making move operations `noexcept`
- Using `std::move` on objects that don't have move semantics (wastes time)
- Not updating all member variables during a move operation
