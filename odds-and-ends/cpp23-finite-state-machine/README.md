# Modern C++23 Finite State Machine Implementation

A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a computational pattern that represents a system with distinct states and well-defined transitions
between those states. The concept traces back to the 1950s when mathematicians formalized it for computational theory. FSMs quickly
became fundamental in computer science, finding applications in language theory, compiler design, and protocol implementations. Over
time, FSMs evolved from simple state tables to sophisticated implementations that leverage modern programming language features.
This implementation specifically takes advantage of C++23 features including concepts, pattern matching, and compile-time
validation to create a robust, type-safe FSM framework suitable for modern software development.

## Use Cases

FSMs solve numerous problems in software development by providing a structured approach to managing state-dependent behavior. They
are particularly valuable in scenarios where a system needs to respond differently to the same input based on its current state.
Common applications include:

- **Game Development**: Character behavior, game progression, enemy AI
- **UI Interactions**: Form validation, multi-step wizards, screen flows
- **Protocol Implementations**: Network communications, handshakes
- **Embedded Systems**: Control systems, device operation modes
- **Parsers and Compilers**: Lexical analysis, syntax processing
- **Business Workflows**: Order processing, approval workflows

The pattern helps eliminate the "spaghetti code" that often emerges when managing complex state with conditionals, improving code
maintainability and reducing bugs. It also enforces separation between state logic and actions, making systems easier to test and
extend.

## Implementation Details

This C++23 FSM implementation offers several key features:

- **Type Safety**: Using C++ concepts to ensure state and event types meet requirements
- **Compile-Time Validation**: Preventing invalid state transitions at compile time
- **Guard Conditions**: Dynamic rules that can allow or prevent transitions based on runtime conditions
- **Transition Actions**: Custom functionality that executes when transitions occur
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logging and state visualization

### Core Components

- `State` concept: Defines requirements for state types
- `Event` concept: Defines requirements for event types
- `Transition`: Represents a transition between states
- `StateMachine`: Main class managing states and transitions

## Example Usage

The included vending machine example demonstrates a practical application of the FSM:

```cpp
// Create a state machine starting in IDLE state
VendingMachine machine;

// Process customer interaction
machine.insertMoney();          // Transitions to MONEY_INSERTED
machine.selectItem();           // Transitions to ITEM_SELECTED
machine.completeDispense();     // Transitions to DISPENSING, reduces inventory

// Maintenance operations
machine.enterMaintenance();     // Transitions to MAINTENANCE
machine.restock(10);            // Adds inventory
machine.exitMaintenance();      // Returns to IDLE
```

## Best Practices

When working with this FSM implementation:

1. Define clear, distinct states that don't overlap in responsibility
2. Keep transitions explicit and avoid creating cycles that could lead to infinite loops
3. Use guard conditions to validate transitions that depend on runtime data
4. Implement meaningful actions for transitions to encapsulate behavior
5. Leverage logging for debugging complex state flows

## Common Pitfalls

- **State Explosion**: Creating too many fine-grained states, making the system hard to understand
- **Hidden State**: Maintaining state outside the FSM that affects behavior
- **Transition Spaghetti**: Creating too many transitions between states
- **Missing Error States**: Not accounting for error conditions

## Performance Considerations

This implementation focuses on type safety and correctness with minimal runtime overhead. The use of std::unordered_map for
transitions provides O(1) lookup in the average case. For extremely performance-critical applications, consider using an array-based
implementation instead.

## Advanced Topics

- **Hierarchical State Machines**: Nesting state machines for complex behaviors
- **Event Queuing**: Processing multiple events in sequence
- **History States**: Remembering previous states for return transitions
- **Parallel States**: Managing multiple active states simultaneously
