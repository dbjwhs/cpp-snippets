# C++20 Spaceship Operator (<=>)

The spaceship operator, officially known as the three-way comparison operator (`<=>`), is one of the most significant additions
to C++20. It was proposed by Herb Sutter in 2017 (P0515R0) and standardized in ISO/IEC 14882:2020. The operator derives its
name from its visual resemblance to a spaceship when written in code. The design was inspired by similar operators in other
programming languages such as Perl, PHP, and Ruby, but the C++ implementation provides additional type safety and integration
with the language's type system through strong, weak, and partial ordering semantics.

The primary purpose of the spaceship operator is to simplify the implementation of comparison operations in user-defined types.
Prior to C++20, implementing all six comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) was tedious and error-prone,
often leading to inconsistent behavior or redundant code. The spaceship operator allows developers to implement a single
operator function that can generate all six comparison operators automatically while ensuring consistent results. This not only
reduces boilerplate code but also improves maintainability and potentially enhances performance by avoiding redundant
comparisons.

## Use Cases and Problem Solving

The spaceship operator addresses several common problems in C++ programming:

1. **Reducing Boilerplate Code**: Instead of manually implementing six different comparison operators, developers can now define
   a single `<=>` operator and get all six operators generated automatically.

2. **Ensuring Consistency**: Prior to C++20, it was easy to introduce bugs when implementing multiple comparison operators
   independently, leading to inconsistent behavior (e.g., where `a < b` and `b < a` are both true). The spaceship operator ensures
   logical consistency across all comparison operations.

3. **Performance Optimization**: The compiler can generate more efficient code by avoiding redundant comparisons that would
   otherwise be necessary when implementing each operator separately.

4. **Type-Safe Comparisons**: The operator returns strongly-typed comparison results (`std::strong_ordering`,
   `std::weak_ordering`, or `std::partial_ordering`) rather than just boolean values, enabling more nuanced handling of comparison
   results.

5. **Improving Code Readability**: By reducing the amount of code needed for comparisons, the spaceship operator makes classes
   with complex comparison logic more readable and maintainable.

## Examples and Usage

### Basic Usage

```cpp
class Point {
private:
    int m_x;
    int m_y;
    
public:
    Point(int x, int y) : m_x(x), m_y(y) {}
    
    // Implement three-way comparison operator
    auto operator<=>(const Point& other) const {
        // First compare x coordinates
        if (auto cmp = m_x <=> other.m_x; cmp != 0) {
            return cmp;
        }
        // If x coordinates are equal, compare y coordinates
        return m_y <=> other.m_y;
    }
    
    // Equality is often implemented separately for efficiency
    bool operator==(const Point& other) const {
        return m_x == other.m_x && m_y == other.m_y;
    }
};
```

### Return Types

The spaceship operator can return three different types depending on the comparison semantics:

1. **std::strong_ordering**: For types with strict total ordering (like integers)
    - Values: `less`, `equal`, `greater`

2. **std::weak_ordering**: For types with total ordering but equivalence instead of equality
    - Values: `less`, `equivalent`, `greater`

3. **std::partial_ordering**: For types where not all values can be compared (like floating point with NaN)
    - Values: `less`, `equivalent`, `greater`, `unordered`

### Best Practices

- Implement `<=>` operator for complex types to reduce code duplication
- Consider explicitly implementing `==` for better performance
- Use appropriate ordering type based on the semantics of your class
- Properly handle edge cases in custom comparison logic
- Use compound comparison to ensure proper ordering of complex objects

### Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to handle equality cases correctly
- Returning incorrect ordering type for the semantics of the class
- Not implementing equality operator separately (can lead to performance issues)
- Incorrect handling of edge cases (like NaN for floating-point comparisons)
