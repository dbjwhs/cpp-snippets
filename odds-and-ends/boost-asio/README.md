# Boost.Asio Examples

Boost.Asio is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level I/O programming that provides a consistent asynchronous
programming model. Created by Christopher Kohlhoff, it became part of the Boost libraries in 2005 and later influenced the
C++ Networking Technical Specification (TS). Asio follows the Proactor design pattern, which separates the initiation of
asynchronous operations from their completion handling. This separation is crucial for building scalable applications that can
handle many concurrent operations efficiently without blocking threads or wasting CPU resources.

Boost.Asio solves several critical problems in network and asynchronous programming. It provides a unified interface for
various I/O services across different platforms, eliminating the need to write platform-specific code for Windows (IOCP),
Linux (epoll), or macOS (kqueue). It abstracts away the complexities of callback management, thread synchronization, and
buffer handling that are common pitfalls in asynchronous programming. The library enables developers to write high-performance
server applications capable of handling thousands of concurrent connections with a small thread pool. Additionally, it makes
sequential asynchronous operations more manageable through composed operations and coroutines, reducing "callback hell" that
often plagues asynchronous code.

## Examples

The examples in this repository demonstrate progressively more complex uses of Boost.Asio:

1. **Basic Synchronous TCP Client**: A simple blocking HTTP client that connects to a server, sends a request, and reads the response.

2. **Asynchronous TCP Client**: A non-blocking client that uses callbacks to handle connection, sending, and receiving data.

3. **TCP Server with Concurrent Clients**: A server that accepts multiple client connections and handles them concurrently.

4. **Asynchronous Timers**: Demonstrates using timers for scheduling and timeout operations.

5. **Strands for Thread Safety**: Shows how to use strands to synchronize handlers across multiple threads.

## Key Concepts

- **io_context**: The central component of Asio that provides access to the underlying I/O services.
- **Endpoints**: Represent connection points (like IP address and port).
- **Sockets**: Communication endpoints for sending and receiving data.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking operations that use callbacks for completion notification.
- **Strands**: Serialization mechanisms that ensure handlers don't execute concurrently.
- **Buffer Management**: Abstractions for managing memory used in I/O operations.

## Best Practices

- Always handle errors in completion handlers
- Use strand objects when accessing shared resources from multiple threads
- Consider using composed operations or coroutines for complex asynchronous sequences
- Be careful with buffer lifetimes - ensure they remain valid until operations complete
- Prefer async operations over synchronous ones for scalable applications

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to call io_context.run()
- Using invalidated buffers in asynchronous operations
- Not handling error codes from operations
- Thread safety issues with shared resources
- Memory leaks through circular references in handlers
