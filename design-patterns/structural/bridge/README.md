# Bridge Design Pattern

The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be
developed independently. Introduced in the influential "Gang of Four" book in 1994, this pattern emerged from earlier software development
practices at Xerox PARC in the late 1980s, where it was initially known as the "Handle/Body" pattern. The pattern's core principle is to
separate abstraction from implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This separation is achieved by creating a bridge interface that
uses composition to connect the two hierarchies.

## Problem & Solution

The Bridge pattern addresses several common software development challenges. In systems with multiple platforms or APIs, it helps avoid
exponential class growth when dealing with cross-platform functionality. For instance, if you have multiple types of UIs (desktop, web,
mobile) and multiple backend services, without the Bridge pattern, you'd need to create a separate class for each combination. The pattern
also proves invaluable when dealing with legacy code integration, platform-specific implementations, and systems requiring runtime switching of
implementations.

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Structure
```cpp
class Implementation {
    virtual void operationImpl() = 0;
};

class Abstraction {
    Implementation* implementation;
public:
    virtual void operation() {
        implementation->operationImpl();
    }
};
```

### Real-World Use Cases
- GUI frameworks (window abstraction from OS-specific implementations)
- Database drivers (database interface from specific database implementations)
- Device drivers (device interface from hardware implementations)
- Rendering engines (shape abstractions from rendering implementations)

## Benefits
- Decouples interface from implementation
- Improves extensibility
- Hides implementation details from client code
- Enables runtime switching of implementations
- Promotes clean code architecture

## Drawbacks
- Increases complexity for simple applications
- Requires careful planning of abstraction hierarchy
- Can make debugging more challenging
- May impact performance due to additional indirection

## Best Practices
1. Use when you need to extend classes in several independent dimensions
2. Use when you want to share implementation among multiple objects
3. Use when you need to switch implementations at runtime
4. Consider carefully if the added complexity is justified

### Books
- "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (Gang of Four)
- "Head First Design Patterns" by Freeman & Robson

## Common Anti-patterns to Avoid
1. Over-abstraction in simple systems
2. Mixing abstraction and implementation concerns
3. Creating unnecessary bridges where simple inheritance would suffice
4. Not considering the maintenance overhead
