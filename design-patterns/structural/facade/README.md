# C++ Facade Pattern Implementation

The Facade design pattern, introduced in 1994 by the Gang of Four (GoF) in their seminal work on design patterns, represents one of
the most fundamental structural patterns in software engineering. This pattern provides a unified interface to a complex subsystem,
effectively reducing coupling between client code and the underlying components. The Facade acts as a high-level interface that makes
the subsystem easier to use, while still allowing direct access to subsystem components when needed for advanced operations.

The pattern proves invaluable when dealing with complex systems that require multiple initialization steps, specific ordering of
operations, or coordination between various components. Common scenarios include multimedia frameworks where audio, video, and input
systems must work in harmony, compiler systems that orchestrate multiple compilation stages, and enterprise applications that need to
coordinate various service layers. The Facade pattern simplifies these interactions by providing a single point of entry while
maintaining the flexibility to access individual components when necessary.

## Key Features

- Simplified interface to complex subsystems
- Reduced coupling between client code and subsystem components
- Layered architecture support
- Flexible subsystem access
- Improved code readability and maintenance

## Implementation Details

This implementation demonstrates:
- Modern C++17 features
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Thread-safe initialization
- RAII principles
- Smart pointer usage

## Use Cases

1. Multimedia Systems
    - Audio/Video playback coordination
    - Device management
    - Resource initialization

2. Enterprise Applications
    - Service layer coordination
    - Database operations
    - Cache management
    - Authentication flows

3. Game Engines
    - Resource management
    - Input handling
    - Physics system coordination
    - Rendering pipeline management

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Over-simplification leading to reduced flexibility
- Facade becoming a god object
- Hiding necessary complexity
- Violating single responsibility principle

## Best Practices

1. Initialization
    - Implement proper error handling
    - Use RAII where possible
    - Maintain clear initialization order
    - Validate prerequisites

2. Interface Design
    - Keep interfaces minimal but sufficient
    - Provide access to subsystems when needed
    - Use consistent error handling
    - Document subsystem dependencies

## Code Examples

### Basic Usage
```cpp
auto gameSys = std::make_unique<GameSystemFacade>();
if (gameSys->initialize()) {
    gameSys->configureDefaultGameSettings();
}
```

### Advanced Configuration
```cpp
auto gameSys = std::make_unique<GameSystemFacade>();
if (gameSys->initialize()) {
    gameSys->getAudioSystem().setVolume(0.8f);
    gameSys->getVideoSystem().setResolution(1920, 1080);
}
```
