# Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. First introduced in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four in 1994, it acts as a wrapper between two objects. The pattern converts the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect, enabling classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. Think of it like a power adapter that allows you to charge your devices in different countries - it doesn't change the underlying electricity or your device, it just makes them work together.

## Use Cases & Problem Solving

The Adapter pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- You need to integrate new systems with legacy code
- You're working with multiple existing systems that need to communicate
- You want to create reusable code that depends on objects with different interfaces
- You need to make independently developed classes work together
- You're integrating third-party libraries or SDKs
- You're dealing with multiple data formats or protocols

Common problems it solves include:
- Incompatible interfaces between systems
- Legacy system integration
- Multiple version support
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Data format conversion
- Protocol translation

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Structure
```cpp
// target interface
class Target {
public:
    virtual void request() = 0;
};

// adaptee (incompatible interface)
class Adaptee {
public:
    void specificRequest() {
        // Different interface implementation
    }
};

// adapter
class Adapter : public Target {
private:
    Adaptee* adaptee;
public:
    void request() override {
        adaptee->specificRequest();
    }
};
```

### Real-World Examples
1. Database Adapters
2. Payment Gateway Integration
3. Multi-platform GUI Systems
4. File System Operations (as shown in this implementation)
5. Network Protocol Conversion

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Keep the adapter simple and focused on interface translation
- Use composition over inheritance when possible
- Create clear separation between business logic and adaptation
- Document the expected behavior of both interfaces
- Consider using the Adapter pattern in conjunction with Factory pattern
- Write comprehensive tests for the adaptation layer

### Don'ts
- Don't add new functionality in the adapter
- Avoid complex adaptation logic
- Don't modify the adaptee's code if possible
- Don't create adapters for adapters
- Don't use adapters when interfaces are similar

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Bridge Pattern**: When you need to separate abstraction from implementation
2. **Decorator Pattern**: When you need to add responsibilities dynamically
3. **Facade Pattern**: When you need to simplify a complex subsystem
4. **Strategy Pattern**: When you need to switch algorithms at runtime

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead for simple adaptations
- Can become significant with complex transformations
- Consider caching adapted results when appropriate

### Maintainability
- Makes system more flexible and easier to update
- Helps isolate changes to external systems
- Reduces coupling between incompatible interfaces

### Testing
- Adapter classes should have thorough unit tests
- Test both the adaptation logic and error handling
- Mock the adaptee in adapter tests
- Verify behavior matches both interfaces' contracts

## Common Variations

1. **Class Adapter**: Uses multiple inheritance to adapt interfaces
2. **Object Adapter**: Uses composition to adapt interfaces
3. **Two-Way Adapter**: Can adapt in both directions
4. **Pluggable Adapter**: Can adapt multiple classes
5. **Default Adapter**: Provides default implementation for interface

## Real-World Applications

1. **Java Collections Framework**
    - Arrays.asList() adapts arrays to List interface
    - Collections.enumeration() adapts Collection to Enumeration

2. **.NET Framework**
    - IEnumerable to IQueryable adapters
    - Stream adapters
