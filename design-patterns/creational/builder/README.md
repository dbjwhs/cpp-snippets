# Builder Pattern Implementation

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that enables the construction of complex objects step by step. First introduced in the
Gang of Four's seminal 1994 book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," this pattern has become a cornerstone of
object creation in modern software development. The pattern addresses the challenge of creating objects that require multiple steps or
configurations during their construction process, ensuring that objects are always created in a valid and consistent state.

## Purpose and Use Cases

The Builder pattern solves several critical problems in object-oriented programming. It eliminates the "telescoping constructor"
anti-pattern, where multiple constructor overloads become unwieldy. It enables the creation of immutable objects while maintaining readable
and maintainable code. The pattern is particularly valuable when objects need complex initialization, validation during construction, or when
different representations of the same object need to be created using the same construction process.

### Common Use Cases:
- Complex object construction in enterprise applications
- Configuration builders for database connections
- Network request builders (e.g., Apache HttpClient)
- Document generators (PDF, HTML)
- UI component builders
- Test data builders for unit testing
- Query builders in ORMs

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Usage
```cpp
auto computer = ComputerBuilder()
    .setCPU("Intel i7")
    .setRAM(32)
    .setStorage("1TB SSD")
    .build();
```

### With Director Class
```cpp
auto gamingPC = ComputerDirector::buildGamingPC();
auto officePC = ComputerDirector::buildOfficePC();
```

## Best Practices

1. Use fluent interface (method chaining) for readable construction
2. Validate parameters early
3. Provide clear error messages
4. Make builders reusable when possible
5. Use const correctness
6. Leverage modern C++ features

## Advantages
- Clear separation of construction and representation
- Fine control over construction process
- Support for complex object creation
- Encapsulation of construction knowledge
- Improved code maintainability

## Disadvantages
- Can increase code complexity for simple objects
- Requires creating multiple classes
- May be overkill for simple construction scenarios
- Potential performance overhead

## When to Use
- Objects require complex initialization
- Need to enforce specific construction sequences
- Want to prevent invalid object states
- Need different representations of the same construction process
- Construction process must be isolated from object representation
