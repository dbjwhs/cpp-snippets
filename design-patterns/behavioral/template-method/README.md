# Template Method Design Pattern

The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that was first formally introduced in the seminal book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (1994) by the Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides). The pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern emerged from the observation that many algorithms follow similar patterns with only slight variations in their implementation details. The Template Method pattern crystallized these observations into a formal design solution, making it one of the fundamental patterns in object-oriented design. Its roots can be traced back to early frameworks and libraries where developers needed a way to provide default behaviors while allowing for customization.

## Use Cases and Problem Solutions

The Template Method pattern effectively solves several common design challenges:
- When you have several classes that contain almost identical algorithms with some minor differences
- When you want to avoid code duplication by implementing the invariant parts of an algorithm once
- When you need to control the points at which subclasses can extend the base algorithm
- When you want to enforce certain steps in an algorithm while keeping others flexible

Common applications include:
- Framework and library design where default behaviors need to be provided
- Application initialization and shutdown sequences
- Data processing pipelines
- Document generation and reporting systems
- Game development for character behavior and AI routines
- UI component lifecycle management

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Structure
```cpp
class AbstractClass {
    public:
        void templateMethod() {
            step1();
            step2();
            hook();
            step3();
        }
    protected:
        virtual void step1() = 0;
        virtual void step2() = 0;
        virtual void step3() = 0;
        virtual void hook() {} // Optional hook method
};
```

### Real-World Examples

1. **UI Frameworks**
    - Component lifecycle management (init → render → update → destroy)
    - Event handling sequences
    - Data binding processes

2. **Game Development**
    - Character movement patterns
    - AI behavior trees
    - Game state management

3. **Data Processing**
    - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
    - Report generation
    - Data validation pipelines

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Eliminates code duplication
- Provides clear extension points for customization
- Enforces a consistent structure across implementations
- Allows for fine-grained control over algorithm steps
- Facilitates the reuse of common code

### Disadvantages
- Can lead to complex inheritance hierarchies
- May violate Liskov Substitution Principle if not carefully designed
- Limited flexibility in changing the sequence of steps
- Can be difficult to understand for developers unfamiliar with the pattern
- May result in tight coupling between base and derived classes

## Best Practices

1. **Do's**
    - Use meaningful names for template methods and steps
    - Document the purpose of each step clearly
    - Keep the template method final (or sealed in some languages)
    - Use hook methods for optional steps
    - Consider making the base class abstract

2. **Don'ts**
    - Don't make the template method overridable
    - Don't change the sequence of steps in subclasses
    - Don't implement too many variations in a single template
    - Don't make hook methods abstract
    - Don't skip calling super class implementations without good reason

## Related Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: While Template Method uses inheritance to vary parts of an algorithm, Strategy uses delegation
- **Factory Method**: Often used within template methods to create appropriate objects
- **Bridge Pattern**: Can be combined with Template Method to separate interface from implementation
- **Observer Pattern**: Can be used to notify about template method execution steps

## Modern Considerations

In modern programming, the Template Method pattern has evolved to accommodate:
- Functional programming concepts
- Composition over inheritance preferences
- Dependency injection frameworks
- Modern language features like default interface methods
- Aspect-oriented programming techniques

The pattern remains relevant in contemporary software development, particularly in framework design and when establishing
standard processes that require customization points.
