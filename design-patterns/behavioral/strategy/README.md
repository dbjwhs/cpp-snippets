# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that was introduced by the "Gang of Four" (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides) in their seminal 1994 book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". This pattern enables defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. The pattern emerged from the need to provide a way to configure a class with one of many behaviors, and to provide a way to change or extend those behaviors without altering the class itself. This aligns perfectly with the Open/Closed Principle, one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented design.

## Use Cases & Problem Solutions

The Strategy Pattern effectively solves several common software design challenges:

1. When you need to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime
2. When you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior
3. When you need to isolate the algorithm implementation details from the code that uses the algorithm
4. When a class defines many behaviors, and these appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations

Common real-world applications include:
- Payment processing systems with multiple payment methods
- Compression algorithms where different compression methods can be used
- Navigation systems that can use different routing algorithms
- Sorting mechanisms where different sorting algorithms can be applied based on data characteristics
- Authentication strategies in security systems

## Implementation Examples & Best Practices

### Good Implementation Characteristics

1. Clean Interface Segregation:
```cpp
class PaymentStrategy {
public:
    virtual bool pay(double amount) = 0;
    virtual ~PaymentStrategy() = default;
};
```

2. Context Class Independence:
```cpp
class ShoppingCart {
private:
    PaymentStrategy* strategy;
public:
    void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy* newStrategy) {
        strategy = newStrategy;
    }
};
```

### Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. Tight Coupling:
```cpp
// Bad: Hard-coded strategy selection
if (paymentType == "CREDIT") {
    processCreditCard();
} else if (paymentType == "PAYPAL") {
    processPayPal();
}
```

2. Strategy Bloat:
```cpp
// Bad: Too many responsibilities in strategy
class PaymentStrategy {
    virtual bool pay(double amount) = 0;
    virtual void validateUser() = 0;  // Should be separate concern
    virtual void generateReport() = 0;  // Should be separate concern
};
```

## When Not to Use

The Strategy Pattern might be overkill in these situations:
- When you have a fixed set of algorithms that rarely changes
- When the algorithms are simple and the overhead of creating new classes isn't justified
- When the context class is simple and doesn't need to switch between different algorithms

## Pattern Variations

1. Static Strategy: Where the strategy is set at compile-time using templates
```cpp
template<typename StrategyType>
class Context {
    StrategyType strategy;
public:
    void executeStrategy() {
        strategy.execute();
    }
};
```

2. Function-based Strategy: Using std::function for lightweight strategy implementation
```cpp
class Context {
    std::function<void(int)> strategy;
public:
    void setStrategy(std::function<void(int)> newStrategy) {
        strategy = newStrategy;
    }
};
```

## Related Patterns

- State Pattern: Similar structure but different intent. State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- Command Pattern: Can use Strategy as part of its implementation.
- Template Method: Defines algorithm skeleton in base class but lets subclasses override specific steps.

## Key Benefits

1. Flexibility: Easy to add new strategies without changing existing code
2. Reusability: Strategies can be shared across different contexts
3. Testability: Each strategy can be tested in isolation
4. Maintainability: Changes to one strategy don't affect others
5. Runtime Behavior Change: Allows for dynamic algorithm selection

Remember that the Strategy Pattern is most effective when:
- The algorithmic variation is significant
- The algorithms need to be interchangeable
- The algorithm selection needs to happen at runtime
- The algorithms can be cleanly encapsulated
