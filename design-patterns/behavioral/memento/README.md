# Memento Pattern Implementation

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state 
(undo via rollback). First introduced in the seminal "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (1994)
by the Gang of Four, it has become a fundamental pattern in software that requires state management. The pattern is widely
used in text editors, drawing applications, and version control systems. Notable implementations include the undo systems in
Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, and Git's commit history. The pattern gained significant traction in the late 1990s with
the rise of complex GUI applications needing robust undo/redo functionality.

## Advantages and Use Cases

The Memento pattern offers several key benefits that make it invaluable in modern software development:
- Preserves encapsulation boundaries while still allowing object state capture
- Simplifies the originator code by delegating state management to a separate class
- Provides reliable state recovery mechanism for complex objects
- Supports unlimited levels of undo/redo operations
- Makes it easier to maintain a history of changes
- Facilitates implementation of transaction rollback mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Originator (Document)**: The object whose state needs to be saved
2. **Memento**: The object that stores the state of the Originator
3. **Caretaker (DocumentHistory)**: Manages and safeguards the Mementos

### Key Considerations
- Mementos should be immutable to prevent external modification
- The Originator should be the only class that can access Memento's state
- Consider memory usage when storing large states or long histories
- Thread safety must be implemented if used in concurrent environments

### Implementation Challenges

#### Memory Management
- Large states can consume significant memory
- Consider implementing state compression for memory-intensive applications
- May need to implement a cap on history size or implement circular buffers

#### Performance Considerations
- Deep copying of complex objects can be expensive
- Consider implementing incremental state saving for large objects
- Balance between granularity of state saves and performance impact

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Use the pattern when you need to provide undo/redo functionality
- Implement state validation before restoration
- Consider implementing state diffing to save space
- Document the complete state that each Memento represents
- Implement proper error handling for failed state restorations

### Don'ts
- Don't expose internal state of Mementos to other classes
- Avoid storing unnecessary state information
- Don't use Memento for simple objects where state restoration is trivial
- Don't ignore memory management implications

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Index Management**
    - Off-by-one errors in undo/redo operations
    - Incorrect handling of branch points in history
    - Failing to properly clear redo stack after new actions

2. **State Completeness**
    - Not capturing all relevant state information
    - Missing dependent object states
    - Incomplete restoration of complex object hierarchies

## Example Usage

```cpp
Document doc;
DocumentHistory history(doc);

// Make changes and save states
doc.set_content("Hello");
history.save_state();

// Undo changes
history.undo();

// Redo changes
history.redo();
```

## Testing Considerations

1. **State Verification**
    - Test complete state restoration
    - Verify proper handling of edge cases
    - Ensure proper cleanup of redo history

2. **Error Handling**
    - Test invalid state restoration
    - Verify proper handling of memory exhaustion
    - Test concurrent modification scenarios

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. Implement lazy copying for large objects
2. Use memory pools for frequent state saves
3. Consider using reference counting for shared states
4. Implement state diffing to reduce memory usage
5. Use compression for long-term state storage

## Advanced Applications

- Implementing multi-level undo systems
- Supporting branching history (like Git)
- Implementing collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- Supporting partial state restoration
- Implementing persistent state storage

## Conclusion

The Memento pattern is a powerful tool for implementing robust state management systems. While it comes with some
implementation challenges, particularly around memory management and performance, the benefits of clean encapsulation
and reliable state restoration make it an excellent choice for applications requiring undo/redo functionality or state
management capabilities.
