## Next Steps
1. Complete extraction of remaining classes:
   - Create appropriate header files
   - Implement each class in its own file
   - Update CMakeLists.txt
   - Remove classes from original proactor.cpp
   - Test functionality
   - Remove original proactor.cpp from build

2. Improve test coverage:
   - Implement tests for the proactor pattern
   - Exercise asynchronous operationss
