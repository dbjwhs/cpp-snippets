# Hash Table Implementation

Hash tables, first introduced by Hans Peter Luhn at IBM in 1953, represent a fundamental data structure that implements
an associative array abstract data type - a structure that can map keys to values. The concept evolved from earlier work
on symbolic key sorting in the late 1940s. Hash tables use a hash function to compute an index into an array of
buckets/slots, from which the desired value can be found. The innovation lies in its ability to achieve constant-time average
complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups, regardless of the size of the data set. This implementation specifically
showcases multiple hashing strategies (std::hash, FNV-1a, and Murmur3) through a strategy pattern, allowing runtime selection
and comparison of different hashing approaches.

## Use Cases and Problem Solving

Hash tables excel in scenarios requiring fast data retrieval and are particularly useful in:

- Database indexing: Quick lookup of records based on key values
- Caching systems: Fast storage and retrieval of cached items
- Symbol tables in compilers: Storing variable names and their attributes
- Spell checkers: Quick word lookup in large dictionaries
- De-duplication: Identifying duplicate items in large datasets

Common problems this implementation addresses:
- Collision resolution through separate chaining
- Dynamic resizing to maintain performance
- Flexibility in hash function selection without modifying core logic
- Performance monitoring and comparison of different hash strategies
- Type safety through templates

## Implementation Details

### Basic Usage
```cpp
// Create a hash table with standard hash function
auto hashFunc = std::make_shared<StdHash<int>>();
HashTable<int, std::string> table(hashFunc);

// Insert elements
table.insert(1, "one");
table.insert(2, "two");

// Lookup
std::string value;
if (table.search(1, value)) {
    std::cout << "Found: " << value << std::endl;
}
```

### Available Hash Functions

1. Standard Hash (std::hash)
    - Default C++ hash function
    - Generally good performance
    - Type-specific optimizations

2. FNV-1a Hash
    - Good for small keys
    - Simple and fast
    - Excellent distribution

3. Murmur3 Hash
    - Excellent distribution
    - Good for all key sizes
    - Optimized for modern hardware

### Performance Characteristics

- Average case: O(1) for insert, delete, search
- Worst case: O(n) when many collisions occur
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Load factor maintained below 0.75 for optimal performance

## Best Practices

### Do's:
- Choose appropriate initial size to minimize rehashing
- Monitor load factor for performance optimization
- Use appropriate hash function for your key type
- Consider key distribution in your dataset

### Don'ts:
- Don't modify keys while they're in the hash table
- Don't rely on iteration order
- Don't assume hash values are constant across runs
- Don't use for cryptographic purposes
