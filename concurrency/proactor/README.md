# Proactor Design Pattern

The Proactor design pattern is an architectural pattern for asynchronous event handling and concurrency, primarily used in
network applications. It was introduced by Douglas C. Schmidt in the mid-1990s as an evolution of the Reactor pattern, designed
to overcome limitations in event-driven concurrency models. The pattern was formally documented in the "Pattern-Oriented
Software Architecture, Volume 2" (POSA2) book published in 2000. Unlike the Reactor pattern which uses synchronous event
demultiplexing with non-blocking I/O, the Proactor pattern leverages asynchronous I/O operations to achieve higher performance
and scalability in systems with high concurrency requirements.

## Use Cases and Problem Solutions

The Proactor pattern excels in scenarios requiring high-performance event handling and concurrency with minimal overhead. It
addresses several common challenges in concurrent programming: it reduces thread proliferation by using an event-driven model
rather than thread-per-connection; it minimizes context switching overheads; it provides a clear separation between
asynchronous operation initiation and completion handling; and it enables efficient CPU utilization in I/O-bound applications.
This pattern is especially valuable in systems handling thousands of concurrent connections, such as telecommunication systems,
financial trading platforms, multiplayer game servers, and high-volume web services where throughput and latency are critical
concerns.

## Core Components

- **Proactor**: Central component that manages the completion event queue and dispatches events to appropriate handlers.
- **Completion Handler**: Interface implemented by classes that process the results of asynchronous operations.
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Represents operations that can be initiated now but complete later.
- **Asynchronous Operation Processor**: Executes the asynchronous operations.
- **Completion Event**: Represents a completed operation with its result and associated data.

## Implementation Variations

Different platforms offer various mechanisms for implementing the Proactor pattern:

- **Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP)**: Native Windows API for asynchronous I/O operations.
- **POSIX Asynchronous I/O (AIO)**: Standard interface for asynchronous I/O in UNIX-like systems.
- **Boost.Asio**: C++ library providing a consistent asynchronous model across different platforms.
- **libuv**: C library with asynchronous I/O capabilities, used by Node.js.
- **Java NIO.2**: Java's asynchronous I/O API introduced in Java 7.

## Comparison with Reactor Pattern

While both patterns handle event-driven concurrency, they differ fundamentally:

| Feature | Proactor | Reactor |
|---------|----------|---------|
| I/O Mode | Asynchronous I/O | Synchronous I/O with non-blocking mode |
| Event Type | Completion events | Readiness events |
| Demultiplexing | After I/O completes | Before I/O starts |
| OS Support | Requires OS-level async I/O | Works with standard socket APIs |
| Complexity | Higher implementation complexity | Simpler to implement |
| Performance | Generally better for high-load systems | Good for moderate concurrency |

## Best Practices

- Use the Proactor pattern when your system needs to handle many concurrent operations efficiently.
- Consider the available platform support for asynchronous I/O before committing to this pattern.
- Ensure completion handlers are lightweight to avoid blocking the event loop.
- Use a thread pool for CPU-intensive tasks triggered by completion events.
- Implement proper error handling for asynchronous operations.
- Avoid deep call chains in completion handlers to maintain code readability.

## Pitfalls

- More complex to implement correctly compared to the Reactor pattern.
- Debugging can be challenging due to the asynchronous nature of operations.
- May introduce callback hell if not designed carefully.
- Not all platforms support efficient asynchronous I/O, limiting portability.
- Error handling across asynchronous boundaries requires careful design.

## Example Code

The repository includes a complete example implementation in C++ that demonstrates:
- Basic structure of the Proactor pattern
- Asynchronous read and write operations
- Event handling and completion processing
- Testing framework to verify the implementation

## Performance Considerations

In high-load scenarios, the Proactor pattern typically outperforms thread-per-connection models by reducing:
- Thread creation and destruction overhead
- Context switching costs
- Memory consumption from thread stacks
- Thread synchronization issues

However, the pattern introduces its own overheads in the form of completion event queuing and dispatch mechanisms. For low-concurrency systems, simpler approaches may offer better performance with less complexity.
