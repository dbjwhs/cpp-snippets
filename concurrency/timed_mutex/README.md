# C++ std::timed_mutex Example

The `std::timed_mutex` is a synchronization primitive introduced in C++11 as part of the standard threading library. It
extends the functionality of the basic `std::mutex` by providing timeout capabilities when attempting to acquire locks.
This allows threads to attempt to gain ownership of a mutex for a specified duration or until a specific time point, and
if the mutex is not acquired within that timeframe, the thread can continue execution and handle the situation
appropriately rather than blocking indefinitely. This was inspired by similar constructs in other concurrent programming
frameworks like POSIX threads and Java's concurrent utilities. The timed mutex pattern has its roots in real-time systems
where operations must complete within specific time constraints.

The timed mutex addresses several critical synchronization problems in multi-threaded applications, particularly those
with strict timing requirements. It helps prevent deadlocks by allowing threads to "give up" after a specific time
period, making the system more resilient. It's essential for applications requiring responsive user interfaces that
cannot tolerate indefinite blocking. Real-time systems, where operations must complete within specific time constraints,
benefit tremendously from this synchronization pattern. The timed mutex excels in resource contention scenarios, allowing
threads to pursue alternative actions if a resource isn't available within a reasonable timeframe. This pattern is also
commonly used in fault-tolerant systems to detect and recover from potential deadlock situations, and in systems with
complex resource dependencies where obtaining all necessary resources within a finite time is crucial.

## Basic Usage Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <chrono>

std::timed_mutex resource_mutex;

void worker_thread() {
    // Try to acquire the lock for 200 milliseconds
    if (resource_mutex.try_lock_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(200))) {
        std::cout << "Lock acquired, accessing resource\n";
        
        // Simulate work
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
        
        // Release the lock
        resource_mutex.unlock();
    } else {
        std::cout << "Failed to acquire lock within timeout\n";
        // Handle failure case - perhaps retry or use an alternative resource
    }
}
```

## API Methods

The `std::timed_mutex` provides these key methods:

- `lock()`: Locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available
- `try_lock()`: Tries to lock the mutex, returns immediately with success/failure
- `try_lock_for(rel_time)`: Tries to lock the mutex for the specified duration
- `try_lock_until(abs_time)`: Tries to lock the mutex until the specified time point
- `unlock()`: Unlocks the mutex

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

1. **Balance timeout values**: Too short timeouts might lead to underutilization of resources; too long timeouts might not effectively prevent deadlocks
2. **Always unlock after successful lock**: Use RAII with `std::unique_lock` or `std::lock_guard` where possible
3. **Avoid nested locks**: Can lead to deadlocks even with timeouts
4. **Consider performance overhead**: Timed mutexes have slightly more overhead than regular mutexes
5. **Beware of spurious wakeups**: Always verify conditions after acquiring the lock

## Advanced Patterns

- **Try-lock pattern**: Attempt lock with timeout, perform alternative action on failure
- **Hierarchical locking**: Establish a lock order to avoid deadlocks
- **Resource pooling**: Use timed mutex to manage access to a limited pool of resources
