# Atomic Operations with Memory Ordering Semantics

Atomic operations represent one of the most fundamental and powerful synchronization primitives in modern concurrent 
programming. This pattern emerged from decades of research in computer science, with early theoretical foundations laid 
by pioneers like Edsger Dijkstra and Leslie Lamport in the 1960s and 1970s. The concept gained practical importance with 
the rise of multi-core processors in the 2000s, when traditional single-threaded programming models became insufficient 
for exploiting modern hardware capabilities. The C++11 standard introduced atomic operations to the language, providing 
a standardized interface based on the rigorous memory model defined by Hans Boehm and others, which allows precise 
control over how memory operations are ordered and synchronized across threads.

Atomic operations solve critical problems in concurrent programming including race conditions, data races, memory 
visibility issues, and the need for efficient lock-free data structures. They provide different memory ordering 
semantics (relaxed, acquire, release, acquire-release, and sequential consistency) that allow developers to balance 
performance with synchronization guarantees. This pattern is essential for implementing high-performance systems where 
traditional mutex-based synchronization would create bottlenecks, enabling the creation of lock-free algorithms that 
scale better across multiple cores. Common applications include reference counting in smart pointers, producer-consumer 
queues, atomic counters, thread synchronization flags, and complex lock-free data structures like concurrent hash tables 
and stacks.

## Examples and Usage

### Basic Atomic Counter

```cpp
#include "headers/atomic_operations.hpp"

atomic_examples::AtomicCounter counter;

// Increment with relaxed ordering (fastest)
counter.increment_relaxed();

// Increment with sequential consistency (strongest guarantee)
counter.increment_seq_cst();

// Get current value
int current = counter.get_count();
```

### Producer-Consumer with Acquire-Release Semantics

```cpp
// Create a lock-free queue
atomic_examples::LockFreeProducerConsumer<int> queue{100};

// Producer thread
auto result = queue.produce(42);
if (result.has_value()) {
    // Successfully produced
} else {
    // Buffer was full: result.error() == "buffer full"
}

// Consumer thread  
auto item = queue.consume();
if (item.has_value()) {
    // Successfully consumed: item.value() contains the data
} else {
    // Buffer was empty: item.error() == "buffer empty"
}
```

### Thread Synchronization

```cpp
atomic_examples::ThreadSynchronizer sync;

// Worker threads wait for signal
sync.wait_for_start();

// Main thread signals all workers to begin
sync.signal_start();

// Workers signal completion
sync.signal_completion();
```

## Memory Ordering Semantics

### Relaxed Ordering (`memory_order_relaxed`)
- **Good**: Highest performance, no synchronization overhead
- **Bad**: No ordering guarantees, can lead to surprising behavior
- **Use**: Counters, statistics where exact ordering doesn't matter

### Acquire-Release (`memory_order_acquire`, `memory_order_release`)
- **Good**: Balanced performance and synchronization, most common pattern
- **Bad**: More expensive than relaxed, less guarantee than seq_cst
- **Use**: Producer-consumer patterns, flag-based synchronization

### Sequential Consistency (`memory_order_seq_cst`)
- **Good**: Strongest guarantees, easiest to reason about
- **Bad**: Highest performance cost, may limit scalability
- **Use**: When correctness is more important than performance

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Good Practices
- Use acquire-release for most synchronization needs
- Prefer relaxed ordering for simple counters and statistics
- Always validate lock-free algorithms with stress testing
- Document memory ordering choices clearly

### Bad Practices
- Don't mix atomic and non-atomic access to the same memory
- Avoid sequential consistency unless you need the strongest guarantees
- Don't assume atomic operations are always faster than mutexes
- Never use relaxed ordering for synchronization between threads

## Building and Running

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./atomic_operations
```

## Performance Characteristics

Based on the included benchmark, relaxed ordering typically provides 2-4x better performance than sequential consistency 
on modern hardware. However, the actual performance difference depends on:

- CPU architecture and memory hierarchy
- Number of competing threads
- Access patterns and cache behavior
- Compiler optimizations
